<a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/realsense/sdk">Intel RealSense SDK 2.0<a/> addon for <a href="http://openframeworks.cc/">openFrameworks</a>

## Story Instead of Addon
I recently bought a new <a href="https://click.intel.com/intelr-realsensetm-depth-camera-d415.html">Intel RealSense Depth Camera D415</a> to use in my openFrameworks projects. Although I studied computer science and used to work as a developer, now I'm focused more on interaction design and I barely remember how to link libraries, include headers etc.

I failed to find an openFrameworks addon for SDK 2.0 or any step-by-step instructions how to use SDK in combination with oF and Xcode. After a few attempts I managed to retrieve and display RGB, infrared and depth pictures from my sensor and decided to share my experience here, hoping that someone will find it useful.

I have an ambitious plan to create an addon for oF, but for now I will give some instructions and code samples.

Again, I am not a professionar developer anymore :) Most probably, some stuff can be done much more efficiantly. Your support will be highly appriciated!
